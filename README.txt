***Introduction***

This repository contains the files to make printed circuit adaptors to aid in the replacement of antique multi-
section electrolytic capacitors, commonly known as "FP-style" or "Twist-Lok" capacitors. These devices are commonly
found in consumer and laboratory equipment manufactured in the mid 20th century. Capacitors of this style are still
manufactured, but are expensive compared to modern discrete components.

***Notes***

The boards have provisions for jumpers connect the negative side of the capacitors to the chassis via the mounting holes.
If the negative side of the capacitors must be isolated from the chassis, do not populate the jumpers.

The large board uses a 2512 surface mount 0 ohm jumper such as a Vishay/Dale CRCW25120000Z0EH.

The small board uses a ---
