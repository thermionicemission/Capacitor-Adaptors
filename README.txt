***Introduction***

This repository contains the files to make printed circuit adaptors to aid in the replacement of antique multi-
section electrolytic capacitors, commonly known as "FP-style" or "Twist-Lok" capacitors. These devices are commonly
found in consumer and laboratory equipment manufactured in the mid 20th century. Capacitors of this style are still
manufactured, but are expensive compared to modern discrete components.
